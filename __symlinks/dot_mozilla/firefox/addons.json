LanguageTool detects many errors that a simple spell checker cannot, such as grammar issues, commonly confused words, and punctuation oversights. Additionally, LanguageTool offers style suggestions to elevate your writing: synonym replacements for overused words, concise rephrasing of wordy sentences, and formal alternatives to commonly used expressions.\n\nLanguageTool is designed with simplicity in mind, instantly analyzing your text as you type. It is compatible with most platforms, including social networks such as Twitter and LinkedIn, and e-mail services such as Gmail.\n\nWith LanguageTool, our aim is to give users a full-feature grammar checker and proofreader that will enable them to have control and confidence over their content. While LanguageTool is a vital extension for non-native speakers, it also recognizes many mistakes that are frequently made by native speakers. This grammar and spelling correction works across several varieties of commonly spoken languages, and is capable of distinguishing between American and British English. LanguageTool also features a personal dictionary for exceptions or words that you might commonly use, but are not found in a conventional dictionary; it will learn to recognize these words for future grammar checking and proofreading.\n\nUnlike other services like Grammarly (a.k.a. Grammerly :-), QuillBot, and Ginger, LanguageTool supports more than 25 languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Polish, and Russian (see below for the complete list).\n\nYour privacy is important to us: By default, this extension will check your text by sending it to languagetool.org over a securely encrypted connection. No account is needed to use this extension. We don't store your IP address.

All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents ETag tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.

These permissions are not needed to install and use New Tab Override:\n\n- access data for www.soeren-hentzschel.at\n\nThe permission to access data for www.soeren-hentzschel.at is only needed if you enable the option to see the latest news about Mozilla as new tab page.

Free plan provides 10 GB of data per month (if you confirm your email address), and the Pro plan has unlimited data and access to servers in over 112 cities in 69 countries.\n\nStill not convinced? Perhaps this elegant list of features will convince you otherwise.\n\nStop tracking and browse privately\nGovernments block content based on your location. Corporations track and sell your personal data. Add Windscribe to your browser and take back control of your privacy.\n\nAdvanced Privacy Features\nWindscribe is not just a proxy extension. It's a suite of privacy tools which include:\n\nAd + Tracker Blocking - Ads and trackers follow you around, waste your bandwidth and compromise your privacy. Windscribe will block all this crap.\nMalware Blocking - Some sites distribute malware. We'll prevent you from ever ending up on those sites.\nSocial Blocking - Social networks are the biggest privacy invaders out there. Block their trackers.\nWhitelisting - Our block lists are not one size fits all. Customize your experience.\nLocation API Spoofing - Sites can request your GPS location why bypasses most proxies and VPNs. Not with Windscribe.\nWebRTC Blocking - Prevents WebRTC leaks that plague most proxy extensions and VPNs.\nTimezone Spoofing - Sites can detect that your IP doesn't match your browser's time zone. This feature solves this problem.\nNotification Blocking - Tired for sites asking you to send notifications? We are too. Enable this feature to never see those things again.\nUser Agent Spoofing - Helps combat browser fingerprinting\nCookie Monitoring - Leave nothing behind. This feature deletes 1st or 3rd party cookies when you close the tab.\nLanguage Spoofing - This feature will spoof your browser's language settings to match the proxy location of your choice.\n\nUnlock geo-restricted content\nWindscribe VPN masks your IP address. This gives you unrestricted and private access to entertainment, news sites, and blocked content in over 63 different countries.\n\nNo identifying logs\nYour privacy is a right. We don’t track you. We don't sell your data to marketers, or even share it with anyone.

If a web site locks you out because your browser does not support a feature they require then changing the User-Agent will not make any difference.\n\n* Also changes navigator.userAgent, as well generating convincing values for several of the other navigator.* properties.\n\n– Translating “User-Agent Switcher” to a new language\nAny help in translating this extension is greatly appreciated! To do so, simply visit our project on the WebLate hosted instance, create an account and either select an existing language or add a new one to get going. Thanks for helping out!\n\n(Alternatively you may submit a merge request on GitLab with the updated translation files or send me the translations using the “Support E-mail”-Address.)\n\n– Getting Help\nFound a bug or want a new feature? Please use the GitLab issue tracker to submit these instead of just mentioning them as part of your reviews. This way it becomes much easier for me to keep track of reported issues and get back to you if additional information is needed to help you.\n\nPlease note however that “User-Agent Switcher” is mostly in maintenance-only mode now and new features will not be added by me (the primary author, Alexander Schlarb) anymore. I'm still open for patches from the community however and would also welcome your support through the linked BountySource buttons under each Feature Request issue in the tracker.\n\n– Watching it work\nIf you want to watch User Agent Changer work, there are a few things you could try:\n\n    Use a web service (such as UserAgentString.com) to see your currently sent User-Agent header.\n    Use the built-in Network Analyzer (Ctrl-Shift-Q) to view the User-Agent header.\n    Enter navigator.userAgent into the Scripting Console (Ctrl-Shift-K) to view the client-side User-Agent value.\n\n\n– Frequently Asked Questions\n\n    Why doesn't the extension work on this very site (Mozilla/Firefox Add-ons)?\n\n    To find out more about why these restrictions exist and how disable them if you must, please take a look at the following blog article: https://ninetailed.ninja/extensions-modify-mozilla-sites.html\n\n    (This information was moved from this extension's description to an external source, since a Mozilla reviewer felt that suggesting changes like the one proposed in the linked article are not acceptable for the listing of sandboxed browser extension.)\n    Why is the extension file so large (4 MiB) compared to others?\n\n    In order to provide almost perfect emulation of User-Agent values, User Agent-Switcher bundles a stripped-down version of BrowsCap. This allows us to derive all relevant JavaScript navigator.* browser/OS identification values from just a single value: The User-Agent value you enter (and a bit of magic behind the scenes). Other extensions with a similarly complete level of emulation used to store all these values in huge tables along with the User-Agent value itself, making it very hard to add new entries.\n\n    Doing this kind of emulation without using BrowsCap would be extremely hard for us, as there are only few rules regarding the structure of User-Agent strings and the most interesting part end up in the extremely browser-specific comment section of the string. As such, we consider these extra 3MiB+ of data shipped with the extension a fair price to pay for having almost perfect out-of-the-box emulation of all these values with no extra user configuration required.\n\n    And yes, the BrowsCap data is here to stay and if you cannot cope with the extra size this causes please kindly download a different extension and don't down-vote. Other people appreciate this decision even if you don't.\n    Can this extension be installed on Firefox for Android?\n\n    Unfortunately Mozilla decided to limit support for extensions on their new Fenix browser platform to just a limited set of recommended extensions. You can read their official “rational” for this on their add-on blog: https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/02/11/faq-for-extension-support-in-new-firefox-for-android/\n\n    If you want to use the extension anyways and are comfortable with switching to Firefox for Android Nightly, they added a convoluted process you can follow to install any extension not official endorsed by them for their new mobile platform: https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/09/29/expanded-extension-support-in-firefox-for-android-nightly/. Note that I cannot test this myself as Mozilla dropped support for my device with the switch to the new platform, but user-feedback so far has been positive.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187816.png?modified=1622132699","width":341,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187816.jpg?modified=1622132699","thumbnailWidth":260,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Icon with Popup Menu"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187814.png?modified=1622132699","width":299,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187814.jpg?modified=1622132699","thumbnailWidth":228,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Random User-Agent Mode"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187817.png?modified=1622132700","width":700,"height":408,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187817.jpg?modified=1622132700","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":311,"caption":"Preferences (Table Mode)"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187818.png?modified=1622132700","width":700,"height":408,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187818.jpg?modified=1622132700","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":311,"caption":"Preferences (Text Mode)"}],"homepageURL":"https://gitlab.com/ntninja/user-agent-switcher","supportURL":"https://gitlab.com/ntninja/user-agent-switcher/issues","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.4108,"reviewCount":185,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":2360,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4183815/uaswitcher-1.4.32.xpi","updateDate":1698136501000},{"id":"{589e6459-3d56-49b4-9b3d-6e4b7ef16940}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/999/999243-32.png?modified=4cbe1626","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/999/999243-64.png?modified=4cbe1626","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/999/999243-128.png?modified=4cbe1626"},"type":"extension","name":"Image Downloader","version":"0.1.1","creator":{"name":"Karl","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13834224/"},"developers":[],"description":"Easy to use and powerful image downloader for your browser","fullDescription":"Image Downloader is an addon for your browser that enables you to download all images within a webpage with just one click.\n\nSimply browse to a webpage and then wait for the images to completely load, then click on the toolbar button to open the app UI.

Conceal your location and unblock geographically restricted websites or content with no limitations on traffic.\n\nFor 10 years AdGuard ad blocker has been protecting its users from annoying ads and spying trackers. Today, over 25 million people worldwide trust AdGuard with their privacy, so we added the brand new tool to even further strengthen their cyber security — AdGuard VPN.\n\nComplementary to all the features any modern VPN is armed with, AdGuard VPN has something more to offer — it’s integrated with other AdGuard products and provides protection from tracking and malware. Join us and surf safely!\n\nMore on why you need AdGuard VPN:\n- Advanced Privacy Protection\n- Unblock Websites and Content\n- Speed & Unlimited Traffic\n- No Logging Policy\n\nWhy does AdGuard VPN require permissions?\nHere is detailed information on the permissions we need. We are always transparent to users about what we use and why we need it.\n\n- `proxy` - This is what the extension does.\n- `contextMenus` - We use this to add a context menu items that allow enabling or disabling the VPN.\n- `management` - We use this to provide an option to turn off another proxy-extension in one click.\n- `notifications` - We use this to show a notification after a successful user authentication via social networks.\n- `privacy` - We use this to provide the “Disable WebRTC” feature which is crucial to prevent websites from detecting user’s real IP address.\n- `storage`, `unlimitedStorage` - These permissions are required in order to store user settings\n- `webRequest`, `webRequestBlocking` - We use these for two purposes. First, we have a webRequest listener that is listening for error events. We use it to detect non-routable (hosted in the LAN, for instance) domains and automatically add them to the list of exclusions. Also, we have an `onAuthRequired` handler that handles authentication for the endpoints that require it.\n- `<all_urls>` is necessary because otherwise `onAuthRequired` won’t fire.

separate script on your computer to work properly.\n\nAn installation guide is available here: https://github.com/frewacom/pywalfox.\n\nPywal is a tool for automatically generating colors based on your wallpaper. These colors can then be used to style your terminal, window manager, etc. This add-on will take those same colors and automatically create a Firefox theme with them, using the Firefox Theme API (no CSS). This allows for dynamic theming, without the need of a restart.\n\nThe reason that you need to install a script on your computer is because Firefox has no way of getting the colors generated by Pywal natively. Generated colors are stored in a file on your computer and the script handles the communication with your browser.\n\nThe colors used for the theme can be customized, either by selecting a color from your Pywal colors or by choosing a custom color using the colorpicker.\n\nIf you are using DuckDuckGo, the add-on has an option to automatically change the colors of DuckDuckGo to match your browser theme.\n\nThere is also an included CSS file that can be enabled. The CSS will style dropdown- and context menus, add bold text and more.\n\nYou can submit issues/bugs here:

button/container name in new tab context menu (right-click):\n– Ctrl + click: opens after current tab if default is at the end (and opens at the end if default is after current tab)\n– Shift + click: opens a new window\n– Ctrl + Shift + click: opens a new private window (if Tab Center Reborn is allowed to run in private windows)\n\n\nYou can contribute by reporting issues, translating, adding documentation or developing!\nhttps://framagit.org/ariasuni/tabcenter-reborn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nPermissions used:\n– Access your data for all websites: to use containers.\n– Read and modify bookmarks: to not open a new window when a tab has been dropped outside the sidebar but on the bookmark bar.\n– Read and modify browser settings: to follow Firefox settings and theme.\n– Display

resources.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/223/223985.png?modified=1622134128","width":1320,"height":1012,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/223/223985.jpg?modified=1622134128","thumbnailWidth":522,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Light
